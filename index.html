    <p id="area_forestopenning" style="color:white;font-family:verdana;">You awoke in the forest oppening. You try to recall what
    happened, but you could not. You hear a wolf howling from a distance. To the north, you spotted a small wooden house. To
    the south, you saw mountains. To the west, there was very little light to see there. To the east, a large iron gate was present.
